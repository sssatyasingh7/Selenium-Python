# Maven
> /meÉªvÉ™n/ â€“ a trusted expert who seeks to pass timely and relevant knowledge on to others.

Maven's goal is to reduce the time data scientists spend on data cleaning and preparation by providing easy access to open datasets in both raw and processed formats.

Maven was built to:

- **Improve availability and integrity of open data** by eliminating data issues, adding common identifiers, and reshaping data to become model-ready.
- **Source data in its rawest form** from the most authoritative data provider available with all transformations available as open source code to enhance integrity and trust.
- **Honour data licences wherever possible** whilst avoiding potential issues relating to re-distribution of data (especially open datasets where no clear licence is provided) by performing all data retrieval and processing on-device.


## Install
```
pip install maven
```


## Usage
```python
import maven
maven.get('general-election/UK/2015/results', data_directory='./data/')
```


## Datasets
Data dictionaries for all datasets are available by clicking on the dataset's name.
